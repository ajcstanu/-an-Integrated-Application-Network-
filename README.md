 Project: Building an Integrated Application Network Using Salesforce and Anypoint Platform

Project Overview:
In this project, students will create a comprehensive application network using Salesforce and the Anypoint Platform. The application network will integrate various systems, including databases, web services, and SaaS applications, to facilitate seamless data flow and functionality. The project will encompass API design, development, deployment, management, error handling, data transformation, and batch processing.

Project Objectives:
By the end of this project, students should be able to:
1. Design and develop APIs using Anypoint Platform.
2. Integrate Salesforce with various data sources and applications.
3. Implement application logic and error handling.
4. Transform data using DataWeave.
5. Handle batch data processing.
6. Deploy and manage APIs on Anypoint Platform.

Project Requirements:

1. API Design and Development:
   - Design APIs using RAML/OAS specifications.
   - Develop APIs in Anypoint Studio to connect with Salesforce, databases, and other services.

2. Integration with Data Sources:
   - Connect to a MySQL database to read and write customer data.
   - Integrate with a file system to import/export CSV files.
   - Connect to a RESTful web service for additional data retrieval.
   - Integrate with a SaaS application (e.g., Workday) to synchronize employee data.

3. Application Logic and Error Handling:
   - Implement business logic within Mule applications to process incoming data.
   - Handle errors gracefully and implement retry mechanisms.
   - Log errors and track performance using Anypoint Monitoring.

4. Data Transformation:
   - Use DataWeave to transform data formats between systems.
   - Ensure data consistency and integrity across all integrations.

5. Batch Data Processing:
   - Configure batch jobs to handle large data sets.
   - Process batch data from a CSV file to update records in Salesforce.
   - Implement error handling and logging for batch jobs.

6. Deployment and Management:
   - Deploy APIs to Anypoint Platform.
   - Secure APIs using policies in API Manager.
   - Monitor and analyze API usage with Anypoint Analytics.

Project Steps:

1. Setup and Configuration:
   - Set up Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio.
   - Create a new MuleSoft project in Anypoint Studio.
   - Configure connections to Salesforce, MySQL database, file system, RESTful web service, and SaaS application.

2. API Design
   - Design the API specification using RAML/OAS.
   - Define endpoints, methods, and data models.

3. API Development:
   - Implement the API in Anypoint Studio.
   - Create flows to connect to Salesforce, MySQL, file system, REST service, and SaaS application.
   - Implement business logic and data transformations.

4. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Add error handling strategies to manage exceptions.
   - Implement logging to track API calls and errors.

5. Batch Processing:
   - Configure batch jobs for processing large datasets.
   - Implement the logic to read data from CSV files and update Salesforce records.
   - Handle batch job errors and retries.

6. Deployment and Management:
   - Deploy the API to Anypoint Platform.
   - Apply security policies and SLAs in API Manager.
   - Monitor API performance and usage with Anypoint Analytics.

7. Testing and Validation:
   - Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman.
   - Validate data integration between systems.
   - Ensure error handling and logging are working correctly.

8. Documentation and Presentation:
   - Document the API specifications, integration flows, and error handling strategies.
   - Prepare a presentation demonstrating the application network and its functionalities.

Deliverables:
1. API specifications (RAML/OAS).
2. Anypoint Studio project files.
3. Configurations for Salesforce, MySQL, file system, REST service, and SaaS application integrations.
4. Documentation of the project, including setup instructions, API details, and error handling strategies.
5. A presentation showcasing the project.
Evaluation Criteria:
- Completeness and correctness of the API specifications.
- Proper implementation of integrations and data transformations.
- Effective error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Successful deployment and management of APIs on Anypoint Platform.
- Quality of documentation and presentation.
